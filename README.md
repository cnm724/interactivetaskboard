# Interactive Task Board

## Description

This application allows a user to input a task name, task due date, and task description. It uses the day.js function to enable the card to change its warning color based on how late a task is. A user can then move task cards into 3 input fields; to do, in progress, and done. Once the user deems the task card no longer needed, they will be able to delete the card off the webpage.
